# elm-aws-cognito

This is a set of client side stubs for using the AWS Cognito services, which are used for managing user identities on AWS.

"Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily. Amazon Cognito scales to millions of users and supports sign-in with social identity providers, such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and enterprise identity providers via SAML 2.0."
